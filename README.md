lWIDS Submission

This repository contains my WIDS assignment submission, organized as individual Python files for each question.
Commit messages may appear inconsistent due to iterative uploads and repository setup;
please ignore commit history and focus only on the final code files present.

I have also put the basic algorithms for DPLL and CDCL I built before making the sudoku and Sokoban solvers.

Theory used: CS logic course slides 1-10 used to understand propositional logic SAT solvers and the DPLL algorithm
            Further I used Prof Anshuman gupta's Lectures to understand DPLL and its optimizations.
            Used freecodecamp for Python at basic level


The submissions include:
                        SAT solver for Sudoku (q1.py)
                        Sat solver for Sokoban (q2.py)
                        basic dpll algorithm (dpll.py)
                        basic cdcl algorithm (cdcl.py)
